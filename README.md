# Badwolf_TW Cogs

These are for [Red V3](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/), an open source self-hosted Discord bot. If this is your first time with Red,
take a look at the [docs](https://docs.discord.red).

## Getting my cogs

`[p]` is your prefix.

Add the repo: `[p]repo add badwolf-cogs https://github.com/kyokusakin/badwolf-cogs`

Then you can install cogs: `[p]cog install badwolf-cogs cogname`

There's a list of cogs below, or you can use `[p]cog list badwolf-cogs` if you've added the repo.

| Cog name | Description | Author |
| --- | --- | --- |
| anotherpingcog | Replace the ping command with a rich embed that shows ping time and message time. It is colour coded: red, orange and green, and the bot owner can customise the colours and emojis for different latency levels, as well as force an embed. | Vexed, Badwolf_TW |
| autoroom | Automatic voice channel management. | PhasecoreX, Badwolf_TW |
| counting | Counting is a configurable counting game. | fakesmile, BadwolfTW |

| inviteblocklist | Automatically delete discord invite links from specific guilds or allow only specified guild invites to be posted. | TrustyJAID, Badwolf_TW |
| uptimeresponder | A cog which starts up a simple webserver whenever the cog is loaded, which can then be used by uptime monitoring services such as UptimeRobot, Pingdom, Uptime.com, or self-hosted ones like UptimeKuma or Upptime.. If you are using an external monitor, you will need to configure port forwarding. Make sure you are aware of the security risks of exposing your machine to the internet. The cog responds with status code 200. | Vexed, Badwolf_TW |
| warnsystem | An alternative to the core moderation cog | retke (El Laggron) |
| tw_eew | Use the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau's API to publish earthquake reports. | Badwolf_TW |
